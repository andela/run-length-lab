#Run Length Lab
+ Create a function `RunLength`, to be a javascript class
+ It takes in a **`string`** argument and returns a couple of instance variables and functions
+ The `encode` and `decode` instance functions, perform a custom encode and decode function, as their names imply
+ For example:
  + Encodong `bbbbggg` should return `4b4g`
  + Decoding `1c2o1k` should return `cook`







## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\run-length.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
